    <p style="font-size: 20px; margin: 40px; text-align: justify;">My name is Romeo and one of my many goals in life is to become a successful real estate investor.  My theory is, no matter the economy or the state of the the world, people will always need a place to live.  With that in mind, my goal is to put the pieces in place to one day create a vast intercontinental real estate empire.  I chose to do coding in order to become abreast with technology, but also as a means of creating my own websites for my business ventures.     </p>
